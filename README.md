LocalGPT is a one-page chat application that allows you to interact with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API without the need for a server, extra libraries, or login accounts.

Simply download the ZIP package(https://github.com/soulhighwing/LocalGPT/archive/refs/heads/master.zip), extract it in a folder, and open the index.html file. Input your OpenAI API key, and you're ready to go. This easy-to-use chat application supports customized prompts, context selection, chat history save/load, and adjustable ChatGPT variables.
 
If you want cloud sync, just copy it to your cloud fold, like dropbox, or onedrive. it's easy and lightweight.
